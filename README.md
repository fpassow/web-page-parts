# web-page-parts
Notebook of HTML + CSS fragments for constructing web pages.

The styles start as scss, because this is really an exercise for me learning sass.

However, the compiled css is deliberately committed and not minified, so that
it will be useful to anyone not wanting to set up a sass compiler.
